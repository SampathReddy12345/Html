    <p> Hi,I'm Sampath Reddy and i'm a MERN Stack Developer.

        *I really love to build a responsive web applications.
        *My ideal work is in implementing/improving applications,
              exploring new technologies and working with great teams.
    
        coming to my projects, recently i collaborated with a team and we worked
     on the really interesting problem statement,
    that is connecting the gaps between each and every individual part of the family
     from the sides of MOTHER and FATHER's relation perspective.
    *Our solution for this is building an app where a USER can create a profile of him
     and adding the details of his family's members in a tree like GRAPHICAL 
    representation of NEURAL network of thier inheritane of a relationship structure.
    *This app helps people to remember the relation in an understanding manner.
    
        One of the challenges facing by people is finding a proper advocate 
    who can serve their legial services with an affordable price.
    myself along with a team built an application to solve this problem using JavaScript& React
    which helps people to get their legial queries solved.
    This app allows people to login & post their quirey and get suggestion by Advocates, 
    Not only this, there is an option called bid which helps people to choose an advocate 
    who can solve posted issue within the budget
    we have planned to implement document sharing and fee payment.
    
        *I'm hopping to handle more realistic problems in future.
         
        *I want to work more products like this and really passionate
     about being part of more in future.
